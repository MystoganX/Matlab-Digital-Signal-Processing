%% Filter Design: Zero-pole placement technique
% by Rodolfo Mu√±oz
%% 1) Zero cancellation
% Let $x$ be the input of the system, where $x$ is given by:
% 
% $$x[n]= 2cos(0.1n) + cos(0.4n)$$
% 
% And we want to filter the low frequency component using a system$y$ that has 
% an *impulse response* of:
% 
% $h[0] = h[2] = \alpha_0  $ ,  $h[1] = \alpha_1$
% 
% Then, the frequency response $H(z)$ is given by:
% 
% $$a_0 + a_1z^{-1} + a_0z^{-2}$$
% 
% As such, it is a system with zeros at the roots of the previous polynomial. 
% To erase the low frequency component, we need to make the *zeros equal to the 
% point of the unit circle with frequency* $w_1$of the undesired component. Then:
% 
% $$H_{zero} = \frac{-a_1 \pm \sqrt{a_1^2 - 4a_a^2}}{2a_0} = e^{jw_1}$$
% 
% $\Longrightarrow$$\frac{-a_1}{2a_0} = cos(w_1)$  _(real component)_
% 
% $$a_1 = -2a_0cos(w_1)$$
% 
% With that, we define the filter and use it to erase the low frequency component 
% of $x$

n = 0:200;
w_1 = 0.1;
w_2 = 0.4;
x = 2*cos(w_1*n) + cos(w_2*n);

a_0 = 3.6;
a_1 = -2*a_0*cos(w_1);
h = [a_0 a_1 a_0];
y = conv(x,h,'same');

%% 2) IIR Filter Design
% The objective is to design a 2nd order filter with the following requeriments:
%% 
% * Magnitude response of $0$ at $w_1 =0$ and $w_3 =\pi \;$ 
% * Maximum magnitude of $1$ at $w_{2,4} =\pm \frac{\pi }{4}$
% * Magnitude response of approximately $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$  at $w_{2,4} \pm 
% 0\ldotp 05$
%% 
% Then, we define the frequency points of the filter:

clear variables, close all;
w1 = 0; 
w2 = pi/4;  w4 = -w2;
w3 = pi;
thresh = 0.05;
%% 
% By the requeriments, the filter must have the form
% 
% $$H(z) = \frac{b_0 + b_1z^{-1} + b_2z^{-2}}{a_0 + a_1z^{-1} + a_2z^{-2}} = 
% K\frac{(z-z_1)(z-z_2)}{(z-p_1)(z-p_2)}$$ 
% 
% where $w_{1,3}$ are the zeros of the numerator $z_{1,2}$. And the frequencies 
% $w_{2,4}$ define at which angle the poles $p_{1,2}$ must be in the Z Plane, 
% as the points from the unit circle closest to them will be the ones with the 
% maximum magnitude. Then:
% 
% $H(z) = K\frac{(z-e^{j\omega_1})(z-e^{j\omega_3})}{(z-re^{j\omega_2})(z-re^{j\omega_4})}$, 
% $0<r<1$

b = poly([exp(1i*w1) exp(1i*w3)]);  % recovers polynomial coeff based on its roots
%% 
% To get the parameters $K$and $r$, we can do a minimization with the 3rd requirement 
% for the filter...
% 
% $$\left|H\left(w_{2,4} \pm 0\ldotp 05\right)\right|\approx \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\;\left|H\left(w_{2,4} 
% \right)\right|$$
% 
% For that we'll use the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, so the result can be 
% obtained with:

r0 = 0.99;     % initial guess for the value of r
optim_ops = optimset('Algorithm','levenberg-marquardt');
r = lsqnonlin(@(x) errorR(b,w2,x,thresh),r0,[],[],optim_ops); % function that minimizes error with the 3rd requirement
a = poly(r*[exp(1i*w2) exp(1i*w4)]);
%% 
% Now, we only need to find the peak value at $w_{2,4}$ and divide everything 
% by it to set the maximum of $H\left(z\right)$ to 1 

MAX = abs(polyval(b,exp(1i*w2)))/abs(polyval(a,exp(1i*w2)));
b = b/MAX;
%% 
% We can check the results with the following graphs:

n = 0:150;
x1 = sin(w2*n);
x2 = sin((w2+thresh)*n);
y1 = filter(b,a,x1); y1 = real(y1);
y2 = filter(b,a,x2); y2 = real(y2);

zplane(b,a)
freqz(b,a)

%% 3) Compensating the effect of a Sample and Hold in a Digital-to-Analog-Converter (DAC)
% The DAC measures the analog signal at specific intervals $T_s$, and records 
% the value sampled as a constant for the whole period. 

clear variables, close all;
L = 256;
n = 0:120;
w_n = 0.15;
x = sin(w_n*pi*n)+2*sin(w_n*0.5*pi*n);
%% 
% Then we can simulate the effect of the DAC like this:

Ts = 5;
window = [zeros(1,Ts) ones(1,Ts)];
x_s = zeros(1,length(x));
x_s(1:Ts:end) = x(1:Ts:end);
x_dac = conv(x_s,window,'same');
%% 
% Which can be seen here, along its DFT:

X = fft(x,L);
X_s = fft(x_s,L);
X_dac = fft(x_dac,L);
w = (0:L-1)/(L-1)*2;
mag = (abs(X));
mag_dac = (abs(X_dac));
phase = unwrap(angle(X));
phase_dac = unwrap(angle(X_dac));

%% 
% As seen in the graph, the sample and hold *adds harmonics* to the the original 
% signal. 
% 
% If we look at the *DAC signa*l like we didn't knew the original beforehand, 
% it looks like a *waveform* that originates from at least *2 main frequencies*. 
% And in the DFT graph, we can see 2 major peaks at frequencies lower than 0.2 
% rad/sample and a pattern were those 2 peaks are repeated over and over, like 
% harmonics. 
% 
% Then, we design a *Low Pass Filter* using the *zeros/poles technique* to filter 
% all the harmonics, that is, we put zeros around the frequencies of the harmonics 
% and poles near the frequencies we want to preserve.

%% 
% With that, recovered the signal looks similar to the original before the DAC 
% sampling. If we plot both signals we can see that the original waveform is indeed 
% recovered with the filter, although with a different amplitude, because the 
% Low Pass Filter didn't have a flat response at the passband:
