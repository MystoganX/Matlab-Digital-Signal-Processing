# MATLAB-Digital Signal Processing

Here we'll look into the depths of analyzing signals in the frequency domain and altered them by using different type of fitering techniques.

1. Introduction
Analysis of how signals are studied in the frequency domain

2. Zero-Pole Placement Technique
Basic filter design approach based on placing specified zeros and poles in the Z-Plane
